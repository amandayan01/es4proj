Here's a snippet incorporating these changes (assuming car4 and car5 have not been declared yet):

```vhdl
-- Car 4
signal car4_top : unsigned(9 downto 0) := 10d"125"; -- Set the starting Y position for car 4
signal car4_left : unsigned(9 downto 0) := 10d"100"; -- Set the starting X position for car 4
signal car4_collided : std_logic;

-- Car 5
signal car5_top : unsigned(9 downto 0) := 10d"165"; -- Set the starting Y position for car 5
signal car5_left : unsigned(9 downto 0) := 10d"200"; -- Set the starting X position for car 5
signal car5_collided : std_logic;
```

Modify the `process(clk60)` block to include motion updates for car4 and car5, setting unique speeds for each one:

```vhdl
process(clk60) begin
	if rising_edge(clk60) then 
		car0_left <= (car0_left + 1) mod 640;
		car1_left <= (car1_left + 1) mod 640;
		car2_left <= (car2_left + 3) mod 640;
		car3_left <= (car3_left - 3) mod 640;

		-- Adding motion for car4 and car5 with different speeds
		car4_left <= (car4_left + 2) mod 640; -- Speed for car 4
		car5_left <= (car5_left - 2) mod 640; -- Speed for car 5 (moving in the opposite direction)
	end if;
end process;
```

Also, remember to incorporate collision detection for the new cars:

```vhdl
car4_collision : collisions port map(player_x, player_y, car4_left, car4_top, car4_collided);
car5_collision : collisions port map(player_x, player_y, car5_left, car5_top, car5_collided);
```

In the drawing process, youâ€™ll need to add cases to draw cars 4 and 5 similar to the existing cases for car0 to car3:

```vhdl
-- Horizontal motion of cars
-- (Existing car conditions unchanged)

-- New car4 condition
elsif (((row >= car4_top) and (row <= car4_top + car_height)) and ((col >= (car4_left)) and (col <= (car4_left + car_width)))) then
	rgb <= "010101"; -- Custom color code for car4

-- New car5 condition
elsif (((row >= car5_top) and (row <= car5_top + car_height)) and ((col >= (car5_left)) and (col <= (car5_left + car_width)))) then
	rgb <= "101010"; -- Custom color code for car5

-- (Rest of the conditions unchanged)
```

Ensure that you define `car4_top`, `car4_left`, `car4_collided`, `car5_top`, `car5_left`, and `car5_collided` signals, map them correctly in the `architecture` section, and add them to the drawing logic. Adjust the starting positions (`car4_top`, `car4_left`, `car5_top`, `car5_left`) and colors (`rgb`) appropriately for the display.
